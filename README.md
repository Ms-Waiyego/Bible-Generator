# Bible-Generator
A webpage that generates an bible verse fetched from an API
This project uses javascript to create a bible verse geneartor
I used the API from https://bible-api.com/romans+12:1-2 that gives a single bible verse.
This API  fetches the bible verse that is in form of json object that is letter transformed to a string that is able to be displayed on the webpage. 
It also has a comment section and a like button to like the verse if it was moving to an individual
I have incooporated javascript to give it functionality css to do the necessary styling and the basic forms of a html file.
